# Spinosaurus Robot 
To build Spinosaurus robot and control it with CPG (Central pattern generator) ,Now we can make it walk straight only and simulate Spinosaurus's swimming that can change mode with Node-red by use MQTT

The Spinosaurusâ€™s carapace is narrow and tall on the sides, differing from the straight carapace of a crocodile, which has narrow ridges when viewed from the top

The Spinosaurus differs from a crocodile in several ways. Spinosaurus has a long, narrow snout with openings near the tip of its mouth. These openings are sensory nerves directly connected to the brain. These sensory nerves help in hunting underwater prey. With just a slight movement, Spinosaurus can detect the prey's location

The Spinosaurus would plunge the tip of its snout into the water and sweep it back and forth. Once it detected movement, it would immediately attack.

 2. **Calibrated phylogeny of Spinosaurus**

The analysis of paleoanatomy updates of Spinosaurus distinguishes two steps in the evolution of hunting and display behaviors. We depict significant changes in the skeletal framework, emphasizing modifications at the cranial end of the torso to enhance neck flexion (the second vertebrae in lateral and anterior views). Below is Tyrannosaurus allosaurus frazilis (Madsen, 1976); in the middle is Spinosaurus chinensis Suchomimus tenerensis (MNBH GAD70); above is Spinosaurus.

In his quest for answers, Henderson constructed a three-dimensional model of a Sphinx based on the findings of Ibrahim's discovery in 2014. He focused particularly on its dorsal fin, which weighed up to a hundred pounds and spanned several feet in length. Additionally, he also developed simulated models of an Allicerator and a Penguinator to further validate and enhance the completeness of the model.

 3. **The tail of a Spinosaurus**

The Spinosaurus has a large tail resembling a fish's fin, extending from the base to the tip of the tail, enabling it to swim gracefully. Many scientists have experimented with the tail of Spinosaurus using three-dimensional models to test its efficiency. They found that its tail is highly flexible compared to other theropod dinosaurs, allowing it to swim freely. The walking behavior of Spinosaurus remains speculative; it may have walked on two hind legs and also used them for swimming, as its hind legs have flat, paddle-like foot claws suitable for swimming. There is also speculation that it may have had webbing between its toes
